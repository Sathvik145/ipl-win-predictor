ipl win predictor 

Machine learing model to predict the probability of winning of a team in the second innings with the current situation details like target score,current score,number of overs completed,number of wickets down

I have used logistic regression model to predict the probabilities
and used different libraries of python for preprocessing of data like scikit-learn,pandas,numpy
and deployed in  heroku
